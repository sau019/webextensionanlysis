# Task 7: Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions

##  Objective
To understand and analyze browser extensions for potential security risks and learn how to manage them effectively.

##  Tools Used
- Web Browser: Google Chrome
- Extension Analyzed: Netcraft Extension

## Steps Performed

1. Opened browser extension settings using `chrome://extensions/`.
2. Since no extensions were pre-installed, I installed the **Netcraft Extension** from the Chrome Web Store.
3. Reviewed:
   - Extension name and publisher: Verified as trusted.
   - Permissions requested: Only accesses web browsing data to identify phishing/malicious sites.
   - User reviews and ratings: Highly rated and reviewed.
   - Purpose:  Detects phishing threats and protects against malicious websites.
4. Found it to be safe, widely used in security communities.
5. Removed the extension after testing for documentation purposes.

## Learning Outcome

- Learned how to check and manage browser extensions.
- Understood that extensions asking for unnecessary permissions (clipboard, file access, webcam, etc.) may be dangerous.
- Recognized Netcraft as a safe extension and used it as a demonstration.
- Practiced documenting and securing browser activity.
